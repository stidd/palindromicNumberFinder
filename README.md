This was a question posed by the World of Engineering Twitter account and I solved it using the programming language Java. The program I wrote allows the user to insert any odometer mileage and it will output the mileage they'd have to drive to reach a palindrome. 

World of Engineering Question:
A car's odometer shows 72927 miles, a palindromic number. What are the minimum miles you would need to travel to form another?
